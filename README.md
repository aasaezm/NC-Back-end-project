Please, bear in mind that after cloning this repo you won't have access to the necessary environment variables. Therefore, in order to successfully connect locally to the two databases, two .env files must be created.
Within .env.development and .env.test files you need to add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here> with the correct database name.
